# PreReqs

I'll assume you already know a little about React,
but if you don't you can head over to their website 
[React Home Page](https://facebook.github.io/react/),
and refer to the diagrams in this article as you go through the examples.  

# Conventions
I mainly use two diagrams schemes I use to think about React component architecture.

## Nested boxes diagram
In the first scheme, componenets are represented by boxes, 
and are nested within eachother in roughly how they will appear on the screen.

## Component tree diagram
The second scheme shows the component architecture as a tree.
